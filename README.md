## Ultimate SQL from ClarionLive

July 13, 2022 - Forked the GitHub Repo with 9+ year old files

Plan to update this fork with current (Feb 22,2022) files in ClarionLiveUtilities.ex downloaded from https://www.clarionlive.com/Utilities.Htm

Updated all LibSrc files, too many changes to detail in 9 years
Updated all Templates files
Added Addins folder

How to install:

1. Copy LibSrc\*.*    into X:\Clarion#\Accessory\LibSrc\Win
2. Copy Template\*.*  into X:\Clarion#\Accessory\Template\Win
3. Copy Addins\*.*    into X:\Clarion#\Accessory\Addins
4. Copy Documents\*.* into X:\Clarion#\Accessory\Documents
5. Copy Examples\*.*  into X:\Clarion#\Accessory\Examples

The above copies can be done with the batch file: CopyUltSqlToClarion.BAT

Demo folder appears to have been replaced by Examples folder. But it did have CustomerSampleData.sql file that is missing from Examples. Will delete Demno eventually.
